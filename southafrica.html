                      <h3>Valley of a "1000" hills</h3>
                      <p>The Valley of a Thousand Hills is a valley in KwaZulu-Natal province that runs between Pietermaritzburg and Durban, South Africa. The area is named after the thousands of hills that tumble down to the mighty Umgeni River, which flows from the distant Drakensberg Mountains to the warm and inviting Indian Ocean. The Umgeni River meets the Msunduzi River (Duzi River) in the valley, and the Dusi Canoe Marathon is run through the area every year.</p>

                      <p>Situated on the Drakensberg escarpment in Mpumalanga is God’s Window. Just one look down and you will begin to understand why it is called "God's Window" Gods Window is so called for the panoramic view of the Lowveld more than 900 m down into lush indigenous forest clad ravine. The majestic cliffs plunge over 700 meters to the Lowveld and the private game reserves which have made the area one of South Africa's main wildlife destinations. God's Window is a small part of a 250km long earthwork of sheer cliffs and extravagant beauty. One can observe the hills and forests as far as the eye can see. In fact, it seems as if one can see forever!</p>
