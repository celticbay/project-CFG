 'Must Have'
- A minimum of 2 html web pages and one external CSS file
- Consistent navbar on all pages
- Styled well
- All links working
- Basic user interaction (Ex: hover, submit form, Action on click)


 'Nice to have'
- All of the 'Must Have' criteria +
- Mobile responsive website
- Effective use of classes and IDs
- JavaScript used to enable user interaction


   Created a wire frame to plan my project used Draw.io
 - (Found this very useful to visually see the project as I imagined it.)
 
 

  The project
- Take a trip around the world - with Captainjack
- See the world through my eyes
- See where the countries visited are in the world
- Learn a little about each destination
- Nautical feel, Neutral pastel colours 


  Html home page
- A header containing a popular quote / phrase from each country
- (Font used from google-fonts)
- Nav bar containing a list of links to take you to each page
- link buttons change colour on hover
- Body contains background-image's that I created in Adobe     Illustrator 
- (One for the homepage an eye with a nautical compass in the center)
- (One with the map of the world in the center of the eye showing a view of the european countries and S-Africa)
- (One with the map of the world in the center of the eye showing a view of the USA)
- Body also contains six buttons one for each country
- (that when clicked show where that country is in the world
- This was achieved by using JavaScript. *
- Footer created by captainjack 2022


  HTML pages
- A header containing a popular quote / phrase from each country
- Nav bar containing a list of links to take you to each page
- link buttons change colour on hover
- Body contains a Portfolio Gallery Grid, displaying images and text information for each country
- All images are my own taken on holiday in each destination
- Each Image has a coloured border that changes colour on hover.
- Each page contains the colours of that country's flag in the footer, header or background
- Footer created by captainjack 2022
- Each page is responsive 

  CSS pages
- btn.css was only used for the home page, as the code used to make the buttons change the background-image
 using java interfered with my initial layout throug-out the other pages *
- main.css was used for all html pages containing the same structure througout
- extra.css not used just somewhere to store code that I may use to refine | add to my project


  JS page
- JavaScript used to make the buttons on the homepage change the background picture *


 *Still some issues with the code on the home page*
 *Wanted to add a form, video and some music*



1. What went right?
- I am happy with the layout of my pages that they are all consistent.
- I love my nautical eye logo which I created from scratch in Adobe Illustrator for this project.
- I like that using the "country buttons" and JavaScript that my home page image changes on click to represent their location in the world
- although it is still not in the correct position and would consider moving the buttons equally on either side of the eye. *
- I'm happy all my links are working.
- All my pages are responsive.

2. Where I struggled?
- I struggled to just use code from bootstrap without fully understanding how it all worked.
- Combining Buttons to change the background picture using java while maintaining the website layout.
- I have spent hours on this trying alternative solutions from different sites - to be resolved. *
- I struggled to stick to the plan at times creating multiple pages and just getting lost in the code.
- I have not fully stuck to the wireframe - but as I learn more I will complete my initial plan.


3. What I've learned?
- Anything is achievable.
- especially if you have great teachers!
- Its ok to ask for help.
- There are multiple sources of information available.
- I actually like code - especially when it works!
